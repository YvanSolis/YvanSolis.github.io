                <p>
                    This is the “standard” version served in homes and carinderias across the country. Soy sauce gives it a dark color and salty flavor. Traditionally, it is eaten the day after it is made, once all the flavors have mixed, reabsorbed, and intensified. Since it involves two kinds of meat, the pieces of chicken are removed from the pot once they’re done, leaving the pork chunks to finish stewing.

                <p>
                    Sinigang is a traditional Filipino dish that is known for its sour and savory taste. It's a hearty soup made by cooking meat or seafood in a tamarind-based broth with vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and eggplant. It's a beloved dish that has been enjoyed by Filipinos for generations and is now a staple in Filipino households and restaurants all over the world.

                <p>
                    The credit for the modern sisig that we enjoy today belongs to a little old lady who used to live by the railroad tracks. Lucia Cunanan, or “Aling Lucing” as she preferred to be called, retained the elements of the traditional Kapampangan dish (chopped meat cooked with a souring agent), but kicked things up a notch by grilling the boiled meat, chopping it up, frying it with pig brains and chicken livers, then serving it on a sizzling plate.

                <p>
                    This pancit variant is so popular that it compelled certain conglomerates to develop an instant version of the stuff. Wheat noodles are stir-fried with soy sauce and ginger, and then tossed with a bevy of toppings from your usual squid, shelled shrimp, and vegetables to the fish balls, sliced pork, and fried, neon-orange tinted quail eggs that are emblematic of the famed Chinese birthday noodles.
